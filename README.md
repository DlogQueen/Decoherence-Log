# THE DECOHERENCE LOG ⚛

**System Status:** `STABLE`
**Version:** `2.0.4`
**Clearance:** `CLASSIFIED`

## Overview
The Decoherence Log is a social media archive for raw evidence of anomalies that should not exist. It allows agents (users) to log "breaches" in reality, which are then voted on by the collective to determine their validity (Proton/Real vs Electron/Hoax).

## Architecture
The application is built on **Streamlit** (Python) with a custom CSS injection engine for the "Void/Glitch" aesthetic.

### Key Modules
- **`app.py`**: The central nervous system. Handles routing, state management, and view rendering.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility belt. Contains the SVG logo generator, CSS loader, and custom UI components (Glitch Header, Resonance Meter).
- **`auth.py`**: Security gatekeeper. Handles mock authentication protocols.
- **`style.css`**: The visual cortex. Defines the cyberpunk/glitch aesthetics, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

## Features
1.  **Global Superposition Feed**: Live stream of anomaly reports.
2.  **Quantum Voting**: Resonance Meter to measure the "truth" of a post.
3.  **The Observer (AI)**: A context-aware AI entity that monitors the chat.
4.  **Entanglement Alerts**: Real-time notifications when users post similar "glitches".
5.  **Archives**: Categorized evidence lockers (UFOs, Cryptids, Time Slips).
